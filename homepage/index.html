        I am from Mardin, went to high school in Diyarbakir, and am currently a
        sophomore physics student at Bogazici University, Istanbul. I am mainly
        interested in physics, programming, Islamic thought, philosophy of
        science, palaeography, arabic manuscripts, and FPS games. I also love
        paragliding, and was a paraglider pilot for over a year. Unfortunately,
        due to lack of time and money, I couldn't continue doing it, but I am
        planning to do it when I graduate and earn some money. I also like
        having conversations with my friends on philosophical matters. I
        generally don't like talking about myself, so I think that's enough for
        now :)

        (By the way, I liked the idea of a personal homepage, so in the long
        run, I will use this website as a personal blog, where I put things that
        I find interesting and useful.)
